# @coder/backstage-plugin-devcontainers-backend

Automatically detect [development containers (devcontainer) files](https://containers.dev/) in your repositories on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket, and have Backstage automatically tag them in the background!

## Screenshots

## Features

_Note: While this plugin can be used standalone, it has been designed to be a backend companion to [`backstage-plugin-devcontainers-react`](../backstage-plugin-devcontainers-react/README.md)._

### Standalone features

- Automatically tag repos from GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket that contain a `devcontainer.json` file
  - Repos are tagged as part of Backstage's [processing loop](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/life-of-an-entity/#processing)

### When combined with the frontend plugin

- Provides an end-to-end solution for automatically managing tags for your Backstage installation, while letting you read them from custom hooks and components

## Setup

### Before you begin

Ensure that you have the following ready to go:

- A Backstage deployment that you can modify
- A GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository that contains a `devcontainers.json` metadata file. [VS Code has a quick-start guide for adding devcontainers to a repo](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container).

_Note: While this plugin has been developed and published by Coder, no Coder installations are required._

### Installation

1. From your Backstage deployment's `backend` directory, run the following command:
   ```shell
   yarn --cwd packages/backend add @coder/backstage-plugin-devcontainers-backend
   ```
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory's `catalog.ts` file
3. Import your source control manager provider of choice (Backstage has built-in support for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket)

   ```ts
   export default async function createPlugin(
     env: PluginEnvironment,
   ): Promise<Router> {
     const builder = await CatalogBuilder.create(env);
     builder.addEntityProvider(
       GithubOrgEntityProvider.fromConfig(env.config, {
         id: 'production',
         orgUrl: 'https://github.com/coder',
         logger: env.logger,
         schedule: env.scheduler.createScheduledTaskRunner({
           frequency: { minutes: 60 },
           timeout: { minutes: 15 },
         }),
       }),
     );

     // Rest of implementation
   }
   ```

4. Import the `DevcontainersProcessor` class, and register it with your plugin creator:

   ```ts
   export default async function createPlugin(
     env: PluginEnvironment,
   ): Promise<Router> {
     const builder = await CatalogBuilder.create(env);
     builder.addEntityProvider(/* GitHub setup */);

     builder.addProcessor(
       DevcontainersProcessor.fromConfig(env.config, {
         tagName: 'example', // Defaults to devcontainers
         logger: env.logger,
         eraseTags: false,
       }),
     );

     // Add any extra processors and handle setup here
   }
   ```

5. As your provider of choice re-validates data and emits more entity information, `DevcontainersProcessor` will automatically intercept the data and append or remove tags, based on whether the current repository has a devcontainers file!

Full example:

```tsx
// catalog.ts
import { DevcontainersProcessor } from '@coder/backstage-plugin-devcontainers-backend';

export default async function createPlugin(
  env: PluginEnvironment,
): Promise<Router> {
  const builder = await CatalogBuilder.create(env);
  builder.addEntityProvider(
    GithubOrgEntityProvider.fromConfig(env.config, {
      id: 'production',
      orgUrl: 'https://github.com/coder',
      logger: env.logger,
      schedule: env.scheduler.createScheduledTaskRunner({
        frequency: { minutes: 60 },
        timeout: { minutes: 15 },
      }),
    }),
  );

  builder.addProcessor(new ScaffolderEntitiesProcessor());
  builder.addProcessor(
    DevcontainersProcessor.fromConfig(env.config, {
      logger: env.logger,
      eraseTags: false,
    }),
  );

  const { processingEngine, router } = await builder.build();
  await processingEngine.start();
  return router;
}
```

## Limitations

This plugin lets the user decide how to bring in repository data. As such, the plugin is limited by (1) what data your Backstage repo provider is able to detect, and (2) what API calls your source control manager supports.

For example, basic devcontainers support has been tested for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, using their default Backstage data providers. That is, all three are able to detect a `devcontainer.json` file at the project root. However, devcontainer files that are more deeply nested in a repo (such as in a monorepo setup) may or may not be detectable. The GitHub API has support for deep searching, but the GitLab and Bitbucket APIs have different policies around how deeply you can search.

We are currently investigating how to add support for deeper nesting for more providers. Does this sound like a feature that you could benefit from? Please open an issue â€“ we would love to know more about your use case!
