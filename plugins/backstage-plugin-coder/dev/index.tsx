 * isolated dev mode, but it needs a running backend process so that it has a
 * proxy to go through. With no backend, all network requests will time out.
 *
 * @todo Figure out how to make proxying available to isolated plugin instances;
 * until then, development will have to be done with a full Backstage app.
